'Humor Sans' is available here:
    https://github.com/imkevinxu/xkcdgraphs/blob/master/Humor-Sans-1.0.ttf

Double-click on font .tff to install

If you install the font, you must first update matplotlib font cache
on windows its usually here:
c:\Users\username\.matplotlib\

You can find the dir of the cache by running in python
import matplotlib as mpl
print(mpl.get_cachedir())

Delete fontlist-somenumber.json (mine right now is fontlist-v330.json) and just run the python program, matplotlib rebuilds the fontlist by itself.
