//proper way to create venv:
//create project dir:
mkdir my_project

python -m venv my_project\venv

//activate
my_project\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

//protip: do not put anything into the env folder
//env-s mst be easily removed and rebuilt without risking project files

//creating a env containing the existing system-wide packages
python -m venv project_name\venv --system-site-packages

pip list --local

pip freeze --local
